## 📌 Overview
**Network Security** is a project aimed at analyzing, monitoring, and securing network traffic.  
It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities, detecting suspicious activities, and ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Key Highlights:
- 🔍 **Traffic Analysis** – Inspect packets & protocols
- 🛡️ **Intrusion Detection** – Spot unusual or malicious behavior
- 🔑 **Encryption & Authentication** – Secure communications
- 📊 **Visualization** – Graphical representation of network flow

---

## 🗂️ Features
- ✅ Real-time packet capturing and inspection
- ✅ Firewall rule simulation & testing
- ✅ Intrusion detection (signature + anomaly-based)
- ✅ Log monitoring & reporting
- ✅ Attack simulation (DoS, spoofing, scanning)
- ✅ Machine learning models for traffic classification
- ✅ Interactive dashboards
